If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it
'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

You can't be mad at me
Just cried my tears, for three good years
Don't pay him any attention
I'm up on him, he up on me

'Cause another brother noticed me
He decided to dip and now you wanna trip
I'm doing my own little thing
Up in the club, we just broke up

All the single ladies, now put your hands up
All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies, all the single ladies
All the single ladies, all the single ladies
