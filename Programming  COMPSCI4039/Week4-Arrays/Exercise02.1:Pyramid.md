Write a program that, for a given value of n (the number of rows / columns), creates a two-dimensional array with that looks like this (here n = 6):
1    2    3    4    5    6
0    1    2    3    4    5
0    0    1    2    3    4
0    0    0    1    2    3
0    0    0    0    1    2
0    0    0    0    0    1
(Hint: youâ€™ll need to write some code to print it out!)
